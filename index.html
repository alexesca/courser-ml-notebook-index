<h1>Links to my notebooks</h1>
<h3>I created multiple notebooks instead of one. Please click on all my links and review each notebook.</h3>
<h3>I was not able to upgrade sklearn, so I was not able to import the jaccard library.</h3>
<h4>I know my accuracy is low, but I focused on understanding each part of the process and was able to modify the data.</h4>
<h4>I feel comfortable with what I learned and I appreciate you taking the time to review my work.</h4>
<h5>I did not hide any code bc I did not do anything different from what the course taught. And I think code should be open and free.</h5>
